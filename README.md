# Traffic-Light-Controller
Modelled in Verilog, traffic light controller synthesised is functional to operate at junction of highway and a country road. 
A camera is installed at country road to detect presence of vehicles, and will provide sensor input to traffic light controller which operates accordingly.
It efficiently manage the flow of traffic, taking into account factors such as traffic volume, priority rules, and safety considerations.
The Verilog code for the controller would involve defining the behaviour and interaction of these components, as well as the decision-making logic for determining when to change the traffic lights.
Here, we have used it to define the various components of the system, including the traffic lights, sensors, timers, and control logic.
